    content: "So... you are thinking of getting 'into tech' or learning to code. One of my biggest pieces of advice is you do not need to do this alone. Building a network and immersing yourself in communities can really help - it sounds scary and sometimes it is - but it is amazing. I love people, I love their unique stories, their experiences. And when the going gets tough - which it will, it is great to have people to reach out to. When you are knee deep in broken code - or grappling with yet another new piece of tech then going to a meet up, or sending a slack message and getting a response can be super comforting. The tech community are full of incredibly talented people willing to work through coding solutions with you."
