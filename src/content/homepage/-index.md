    content: "So you are thinking of getting 'into tech' or learning to code. One of my biggest pieces of advice is you do not need to do this alone. Build a network and immerse yourself in communities - it sounds scary and sometimes it is - but it is amazing. I love people, I love their stories, their experiences. And when the going gets tough - which it will, it is great to have people to reach out too. Or when you are knee deep in broken code - or grappling with yet another new piece of tech then going to a meet up, or sending a community a slack and getting a response can be super comforting. The tech community are full of incredibly talented people willing to work through coding solutions with you."
