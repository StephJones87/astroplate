I'm Steph — a clinical pharmacist turned data engineer with a passion for helping women confidently enter the world of tech. After having my first child, I pivoted careers through a coding internship and taught myself Python. Since then, I’ve worked across data science, software, and engineering roles, with a focus on making messy data meaningful.

I’m deeply motivated by creating content that support others on their learning journeys — especially women returning to work, changing careers, or just getting started. I’ve taught over 150 women to code through Code First Girls.

This site is my corner of the internet to share resources, stories, and experiments from my coding life — as well as reminders that you don’t need to know everything to start building something great.
